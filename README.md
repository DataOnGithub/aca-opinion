# Overview

This repository contains state-level estimates of favorability toward the Affordable Care Act for 2012 and all of the code and data (except for the original surveys from Roper) necessary to re-created them. To produce the estimates, I combine data from the Kaiser Tracking Poll from January 2012 to November 2012 with Census data and Obama's 2012 vote share using multilevel regression with post-stratification. I use individuals' states, sex, race (and the interaction of race and sex), age, education, and income in the poststratification ([Lax and Phillips 2009a](http://www.columbia.edu/~jhp2121/publications/HowShouldWeEstimateOpinion.pdf), [2009b](http://www.columbia.edu/~jrl2124/Lax_Phillips_Gay_Policy_Responsiveness_2009.pdf)). I rely on the [MRP package](https://github.com/malecki/mrp) to do the computation. 

Note the the repository also include cleaned and recoded Kaiser Tracking polls (and the code to do the cleaning) up to November 2013 (there were no polls in January, May, or July). However, these data are not included in the current estimates, because I need them for 2012 for [this project](http://www.carlislerainey.com/files/need.pdf). However, these data can easily be included in the estimates with small changes to `mrp.R`.

## ACA Favorability

To estimate the percent of a state's citizens that support expanding Medicaid under the ACA, I use the [following question](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/CFIDE/cf/action/ipoll/questionDetail.cfm?keyword=health%20AND%20%20reform&keywordoptions=1&exclude=&excludeOptions=1&topic=Any&organization=Kaiser&label=&fromdate=1/1/1935&toDate=12/31/2014&stitle=&sponsor=Henry%20J.%20Kaiser%20Family%20Foundation&studydate=01-JAN-34&sample=1504&qstn_list=&qstnid=1849005&qa_list=&qstn_id4=1849005&study_list=&lastSearchId=7556665&archno=&keywordDisplay=), which appears in each Kaiser Tracking Poll from January 2012 to November 2012:

> As you may know, a health reform bill was signed into law in 2010. Given what you know about the health reform law, do you have a generally favorable or generally unfavorable opinion of it? 

## Support for Medicaid Expansion

To estimate the percent of a state's citizens that support expanding Medicaid under the ACA, I use the [following question](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/CFIDE/cf/action/ipoll/questionDetail.cfm?keyword=medicaid%20AND%20%20expansion&keywordoptions=1&exclude=&excludeOptions=1&topic=Any&organization=Kaiser&label=&fromdate=1/1/1935&toDate=12/31/2014&stitle=&sponsor=Henry%20J.%20Kaiser%20Family%20Foundation&studydate=July%2017-23,%202012&sample=1227&qstn_list=&qstnid=1814816&qa_list=&qstn_id4=1814816&study_list=&lastSearchId=7559814&archno=USPSRA2012-HNI112&keywordDisplay=), which appears only in the July 2012 Kaiser Tracking Poll:

> As you may know, the (2010) health care law expands Medicaid to provide health insurance to more low-income uninsured adults, including adults with no children whose incomes are below about $16,000 a year. The federal government will initially pay the entire cost of this expansion, and after several years, states will pay 10 percent and the federal government will pay 90 percent. The Supreme Court ruled that states may choose whether or not to participate in this expansion. What do you think your state should do? Keep Medicaid as it is today, with no new funding from the federal government and no change in who will be covered by the program or expand Medicaid to cover more low-income uninsured people, with the federal government initially paying the entire cost of the expansion and your state eventually paying 10 percent.

Although the number of respondents is below the minimum number of 1,400 recommended by [Lax and Phillips (2009a)](http://www.columbia.edu/~jhp2121/publications/HowShouldWeEstimateOpinion.pdf), I believe I have a *very* good state-level predictor in Obama's 2012 vote share. 


A [very similar question](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/CFIDE/cf/action/ipoll/questionDetail.cfm?keyword=medicaid%20AND%20%20expansion&keywordoptions=1&exclude=&excludeOptions=1&topic=Any&organization=Kaiser&label=&fromdate=1/1/1935&toDate=12/31/2014&stitle=&sponsor=Henry%20J.%20Kaiser%20Family%20Foundation&studydate=April%2015-20,%202013&sample=1203&qstn_list=&qstnid=1832282&qa_list=&qstn_id4=1832282&study_list=&lastSearchId=7559814&archno=USPSRA2013-HNI119&keywordDisplay=) was asked in the April and March 2013 Kaiser Tracking polls, but these data are not included in the current estimates.


## Support for the Tea Party

To estimate the percent of a state's citizens that support the Tea Party, I use the [following question](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/CFIDE/cf/action/ipoll/questionDetail.cfm?keyword=tea%20AND%20%20party&keywordoptions=1&exclude=&excludeOptions=1&topic=Any&organization=Kaiser&label=&fromdate=1/1/1935&toDate=12/31/2014&stitle=&sponsor=Henry%20J.%20Kaiser%20Family%20Foundation&studydate=01-JAN-34&sample=1504&qstn_list=&qstnid=1849048&qa_list=&qstn_id4=1849048&study_list=&lastSearchId=7559807&archno=&keywordDisplay=), which appears in each Kaiser Tracking Poll from January 2012 to November 2012:

> Do you consider yourself to be a supporter of the Tea Party movement, or not?

Note the the Tea Party question was also asked in the February, September, October, and November tracking polls in 2013, though these are not included in the current estimates.

The estimates are presented in the plots below and available for download [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlislerainey/ACA_Opinion/master/Data/mrp_est.csv). 

## The Estimates

# Files

There are several parts to the projects. First, there are the original survey files available on Roper. These are not posted as part of the repository, but instead must be downloaded directly from Roper. However, the cleaned files from each survey are available.

* The directory `R_Code` contains all the R code necessary to recreate the MRP estimates, starting with the original survey data from Kaiser available on Roper.
	* The directory `Clean_Polls` contains the scripts to clean and the original survey files and recode the variables into a more usable form. The files in this directory have the form `PollingOrganization_Year_Month.R`. At this point, I'm only using data from Kaiser from January 2012 to November 2013 (except for December 2012 and January, May, and July 2013, which are not available).
	* The file `clean_poll_data.R` simply runs each script in the directory `Clean_Polls`. This cleans and recodes all of the original data sets from Roper and places them in the directory `Data/Cleaned_Poll_Data`. These data set have the name `PollingOrganization_Year_Month.csv`.
	* The file `merge_poll_data.R` simply merges all of the individual polls into a single data set called `poll_data.csv` and places it in the `Data` directory.
	* The file `mrp.R` performs the entire anlysis by sourcing the files `clean_poll_data.R` and `merge_poll_data.R`, and `create_figures.R` and then performing the MRP. It produces a file called `mrp_est.csv` and saved it in the `Data` directory. 
	* The file `create_figures.R` creates the map and line plot that summarize the MRP estimates. These figures are `mrp_est.png` and `mrp_est_map.png` and available in the `Figures` directory.
	
* The directory `Data` does not contain the original surveys from Roper, but it does contain all the derivate data sets.
	* The directory `Aggregate_Data` contains state-level data. `obama2012.csv` contains Obama's 2012 vote share in each state. `region.csv` contains the region in which each state falls. `state_names.csv` contains the state names and abbreviations.
	* The directory `Cleaned_Poll_Data` contains the cleaned versions of each of the Roper surveys. They follow the naming convention `PollingOrganization_Year_Month.csv`.
	* The file `poll_data.csv` contains the cleaned, recoded, and merged individual-level survey data. It includes the variable `aca.fav`, which indicates whether the individual views the 2010 ACA favorably or not, and the democraphic variables `sex`, `race`, `sex.race`, `age`, `education`, and `income`, all with the obvious meanings.
	* The file `mrp_est.csv` contains the variables `percent_favorable_aca`, which are the state-level MRP estimates, and `state_abbr`.
